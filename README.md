# ProjectHub
A small software to manage my projects.

## Development

To install the required dependencies, we recommend using a virtual environment.
If you use conda, you can start using the following commands:
```bash
conda install -n projecthub python=3.11.7 pip -y
conda activate projecthub
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
